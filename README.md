# Useful Roc Examples

We want the examples website to be the place to find up-to-date, roc-expert-approved answer to common search queries of the nature "How to X in roc".

ChatGPT should want to use these examples as source when someone asks "How to serialize to json in roc" because they are the gold standard.

Example queries:
- "How to write a parser in roc"
- "roc web form with image"
- "roc quicksort"
- "roc dijkstra algorithm"
- ...

The code snippets should provide the answer to the question and nothing more. Nuanced explanations, suggestions for further reading and links to other examples can be provided in the text part of the example.

## Running an example

You can run these examples using the [Roc cli](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/getting_started#installation) e.g. `roc run examples/json-basic/main.roc`. 

## To view the examples site locally

```
roc run main.roc -- examples build 
```

Then copy the static assets from `/www` to `/build`.

If you're using the nix flake simple-http-server will already be installed. Without nix you can install it with `cargo install simple-http-server`.

View the website:
```
cd /build
simple-http-server --nocache
```

Some additional notes to consider for Example developers:
- These Examples should support a variety of needs such as application templates, content for guides and tutorials, and helpful scripts.
- Try to keep the scope of your Example in mind. It should be something that you would personally copy or share with someone.
- The platform and any packages should be URLs and not relative links. It should be as easy as navigating to a relevant example, copying it into a file, and now you have working code!
- Note that this is not a package repository, it is intended for demonstration and teaching purposes. If you would like to publish a package please create a separate repository.
